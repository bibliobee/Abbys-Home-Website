    Paid consulting projects and mentorships<br />

    Whistler Writer in Residence MentorshipAugust to November 2022<br />
    I was the scholarship recipient of the Fall 2022 WWR mentorship program. I
    was one of 7 writer participants to receive mentorship on our manuscripts
    from the Writer in Residence, author Shaena Lambert (author of Petra, Oh My
    Darling, Radiance and The Falling Woman).<br />

    Generously sponsored by The Resort Municipality of Whistler’s Community
    Enrichment Program.<br />

    Program Info Black, embossed, closed book on a grey surface Book Coverage
    June 2022 Contract work for a Vancouver-based production company where I
    wrote a coverage report of the program’s novel to advise on the viability of
    the program s a potential tv show.<br />

    Trent University guest lecture appearance February 2021<br />
    I was invited by Trent University, Ontario to give a guest lecture to a Poli
    100 undergrad class about the experience of campaigning for a provincial
    election candidate during a pandemic in 2020. My candidate ran in a
    highly-contested riding, Vancouver-Langara (British Columbia, Canada)
    against a strong incumbent. While we didn’t win this riding, our election
    results were among the closest and tightest in the province. I shared with
    the students some lessons about campaigning over Zoom, a healthy campaign
    culture, digital organizing, and protecting mental health against
    burnout.<br />
