    Trent University guest lecture appearance February 2021<br />
    I was invited by Trent University, Ontario to give a guest lecture to a Poli
    100 undergrad class about the experience of campaigning for a provincial
    election candidate during a pandemic in 2020. My candidate ran in a
    highly-contested riding, Vancouver-Langara (British Columbia, Canada)
    against a strong incumbent. While we didn’t win this riding, our election
    results were among the closest and tightest in the province. I shared with
    the students some lessons about campaigning over Zoom, a healthy campaign
    culture, digital organizing, and protecting mental health against
    burnout.<br />
