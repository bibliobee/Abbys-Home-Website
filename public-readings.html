    Vancouver Writers FestPublic ReadingOctober 2022 I gave a reading of my work
    from Emerge 22, the self-published anthology produced annually by the SFU
    Creative Writing department. I was one of 15 students from the 2022 cohort
    of Simon Fraser University’s The Writer’s Studio to read my work at the
    Vancouver Writers Fest during the anthology’s in-person launch event. <br />

    featureMay 2021 I was one of several artists featured in a fundraiser in May
    2021 by Threading Change for Asian Heritage Month. I read an excerpt of one
    of my short stories, Buko, about Filipino diasporic identity explored
    through cultural cuisines, with a sprinkle of romance. <br />

    The fundraiser proceeds benefitted organizations that advance anti-racism
    policy, build educational capacity and increase the visibility of Asian
    artists and change-makers in the community.<br />
